# Here I have written code for anime recomnedation.
## This is what I have done:-
### >Merged the data sets AnimeList.csv and Anime_Data.csv to make a new data set 'AnimeDict'.
### >Performing memory efficient searching with Global Secondary Index.
### >Re Structioring of data.
### >Used levenshtein distance algorithm to find out most similar result.
## To run the code:
### 1.Cloce the github repository in your computer. git clone https://github.com/shishank2311/expert_session_one_shishank-agrawal.git
### 2.Run Data_Preperation.ipynb file which will create two json files in Data_Sets folder.
### 3.Run Data_Base_Search.ipynb file to search for anime titles across the newly created data store.
